#Two-Day Project Thoughts and Feedback#
###_I worked in a three-person group for the two-day project; it was a bit tricky figuring out and divvying up the workload betwixt the three of us, but we ended up essentially having 2 people pair and the third working on a peripheral part of the project.  It took a little time to get used to._###

##Regarding learning/styling processes:##
###_It was fairly exploratory.  We wound up doodling out the templates because we were getting frustrated with coding them out (we ended up with 3 ideas and got to coding two of them._###

##Planning/Implementation##
###_Working from big to small did not work out very well.  I am used to working from mobile to large, but at least it was a step outside of my comfort zone.  However, what worked was working from the top to bottom after setting up the template - the template definitely helped speed the project long towards the end when smaller details were being added._###

|Element|Why|How/Example|
|:-:|:--:|:--:|
|Variables|We no longer need to go through the entire documentation to make adjustments to large groups.|In the variables partial in the SCSS file, there are variables for media query sizes and background color.|
|Media Queries|It changes the site's appearance depending on the viewport|The media queries are referred to throughout the SCSS when a change needs to be made for factors such as grid arrangement.|
|Mixins|Cleans the code so it isn't as repetitive for certain clusters of code|There is a mixin for display flex and centering content|
|Folder Structure|It organizes the CSS, dividing it up by partials|There is code for background in the backgrounds partial in the SCSS, within the "layout" directory.|
|Partials|Helps to organize the folder structure, based on what is in it|Things that go within the header is in the _header.scss partial in "layout"|

##How I will change my approach today##
###_I'll work from small to big, outside to inside (in that order).  I'd like to tinker with calculations at some point since it looked pretty useful.  It's a shame we didn't get in-depth with loops on Wednesday/Thursday either, so I'd like to try those out also._###
